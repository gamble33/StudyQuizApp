Hello
today I set out to create a little program to approximate the area under a curve
using, first rectangles, then trapezoids and deriving the trapezoid rule from it.
This video should help you get a better idea of what integration really is and
I recommend you follow along, maybe code the same project but in a different language
like python with matplotlib and numpy. This is guaranteed to help you solidify your knowledge
When I first started learning calculus, programming these concepts very much helped me reach
a greater understanding of the subject
